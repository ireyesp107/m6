# M6: GAS (Gutenburg Automated Search)
> Full name: `Josue Cruz, Isaias Reyes, Nick Masi, Jackson Davis `


## Summary

Implementation of a distributed and scalable search engine for the Project Gutenberg dataset with rapid query capabilities. We leverage the unique structure of the ATLAS Group mirror of the dataset to accelerate our distributed execution engine's computation. This project was undertaken as part of CS1380 at Brown University.

Note: Our Gutenburg workflow lives in test/crawl.test.js
